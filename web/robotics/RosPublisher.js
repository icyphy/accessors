/** This accessor advertises and publishes to a ROS topic. It extends
 * the WebSocketClient to communicate to a rosbridge websocket. <br>
 *
 * During intialize, it will advertise the topic it will publish to,
 * along with its type. The purpose of 'advertise' here is to
 * establish the ROS topic if isn't already established. This is
 * slightly different from the 'advertise' function in NodeHandle
 * which simply publicizes that the the node will be publishing
 * messages to the topic.
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the topic does not already exist, and the type is valid, a
 * topic will be established with this type.</li>
 * <li>If the topic already exists with a different type, no new topic
 * will be established</li>
 * <li>If the topic already exists with the same type, no new topic
 * will be established.</li>
 * <li>If the topic already exists but the type isn't resolved, no new
 * topic will be established.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *  On input from 'toSend', this accessor publishes that input to the
 *  aforementioned topic.
 *  The input from 'toSend' must be in JSON form, and must match the message
 *  datatype that the ROS topic is expecting. For example if ROS topic is
 *  expecting <code>std_msgs/String</code>, then the input in 'toSend' should be
 *  as follows:
 *  <pre> { "data": "hello world" } </pre>
 *  Some ROS types contain a header which consists of a sequence,
 *  timestamp, and a frame_id. If the ROS type has a header, you can
 *  either:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>send the message on toSend without the header, and check the
 *  parameter 'addHeader'. This sends the message with a header with
 *  only the frame_id specified, and rosbridge will add the sequence
 *  and timestamp for you.</li>
 *  <li>send a fully formed message with all fields in the header
 *  included and don't check the parameter 'addHeader'.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  This accessor doesn't do any error checking. All error messages
 *  orginate from rosbridge and will appear on the console running
 *  rosbridge. More information ccan be viewed on the <a href='https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/blob/groovy-devel/ROSBRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md'>rosbridge
 *  protocol specification</a> site.
 *
 *  @accessor robotics/RosPublisher
 *  @parameter {string} topic The ROS topic to publish to.
 *  @parameter {string} ROStype The ROS datatype of the topic.
 *  @parameter {boolean} addHeader If (true), this accessor will send a header with a blank seq and timestamp field, and rosbridge will add the header for you.
 *  @parameter {string} frame_id The frame_id of the header (only needed if a header is required).
