/** This accessor sends and/or receives messages from an XBee radio located on a
 *  specified serial port on the host. The accessor lists all the serial ports
 *  that it finds as options, although most likely only some of these are actually
 *  XBee radio devices. It is quite tricky to get this accessor working, as you have
 *  to have properly configured the XBee devices, for example to be on the same
 *  network as each other and to use the same baud rate as specified in this
 *  accessor. Information about XBee devices can be found here:
 *
 *  * https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/wiki/Main/XBee
 *
 *
 *  Whenever an input is received on the `toSend` input,
 *  the data on that input is sent to the serial port, and then presumably over
 *  the readio.
 *
 *  Whenever a message is received from the serial port, that message is
 *  produced on the `received` output.
 *
 *  When `wrapup()` is invoked, this accessor closes the serial port.
 *
 *  The send and receive types can be any of those supported by the host.
 *  The list of supported types will be provided as options for the `sendType`
 *  and `receiveType` parameters. For the Ptolemy II host, these include at
 *  least 'string', 'number', and a variety of numeric types.
 *
 *  If both ends of the socket are known to be JavaScript clients,
 *  then you should use the 'number' data type for numeric data.
 *  If one end or the other is not JavaScript, then
 *  you can use more specified types such as 'float' or 'int', if they
 *  are supported by the host. In all cases, received numeric
 *  data will be converted to JavaScript 'number' when emitted.
 *  For sent data, this will try to convert a JavaScript number
 *  to the specified type. The type 'number' is equivalent
 *  to 'double'.
 *
 *  When type conversions are needed, e.g. when you send a double
 *  with `sendType` set to int, or an int with `sendType` set to byte,
 *  then a "primitive narrowing conversion" will be applied, as specified here:
 *  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3 .
 *
 *  For numeric types, you can also send an array with a single call
 *  to this.send(). The elements of the array will be sent in sequence all
 *  at once, and will be received in one batch and emitted as an array.
 *
 *  Accessors that extend this one can override the `toSendInputHandler` function
 *  to customize what is sent.
 *
 *  This accessor requires the 'xbee' module.
 *
 *  @accessor net/XBee
 *
 *  @input toSend The data to be sent over the radio.
 *  @output received The data received from the radio.
 *
 *  @parameter {int} port The port on the server to connect to. This defaults to the
 *   last (most recently added, presumably) serial port in the list of serial ports on
 *   the host.
 *  @parameter {string} receiveType See above.
 *  @parameter {string} sendType See above.
