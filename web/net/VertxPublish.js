/** Publish to a Vert.x event bus, which is a peer-to-peer publish-and-subscribe system.
 *  The published data will be sent to any subscriber that subscribes to the same
 *  address and runs in the same Vertx cluster (see the VertxSubscribe accessor).
 *  The Vertx cluster normally includes all machines that hear multicast packets
 *  sent by the machine hosting this accessor.
 *
 *  The input to be published can be any data type supported by accessors that
 *  has a string representation in JSON syntax. The data will be converted to a
 *  string in JSON format and sent to the event bus. The VertxSubscribe accessor
 *  will parse that string and output the data in the native format of its host.
 *
 *  If the broadcast input is set to false, then instead of broadcasting the
 *  message to all subscribers, the Vertx bus will pick exactly one subscriber
 *  and send the message to it.  The bus picks the subscribers in an approximately
 *  round-robin fashion. If the subscriber replies to this message, then that
 *  will reply (required to be also be a JSON object) will be produced on the
 *  reply output port.
 *
 *  The busHost input specifies the name of the network interface through which
 *  to connect to the Vert.x event bus cluster, and busHostPort specifies the
 *  port to use for this. Normally, you can leave these at their default values
 *  unless you need to need to use a network interface that is not 'localhost'
 *  or you need to use a particular port. These two inputs are examined only
 *  at initialization time, so changing them during execution of a swarmlet
 *  will have no effect.
 *

 *  @author Patricia Derler, Edward A. Lee, Ben Zhang
 *  @version $$Id$$
 *  @input {string} address The event bus address, which is the name of the event stream.
 *   This defaults to 'topic'.
 *  @input message The message to publish.
 *  @input {boolean} broadcast Indicator of whether to send to all subscribers or just one.
 *   This defaults to true, which means to send to all subscribers.
 *  @parameter {string} busHost The name of the network interface to use for the Vert.x
 *   event bus. A blank string is interpreted as 'localhost' (the default).
 *  @parameter {int} busHostPort The port for the Vert.x event bus. A value of 0
 *   indicates to just find an available port (the default).
 *  @output reply The reply, if any, received after a point-to-point send
 *   (where broadcast == false).
