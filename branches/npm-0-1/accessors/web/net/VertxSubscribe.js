/** This accessor subscribes to a Vert.x event bus, which is a peer-to-peer
 *  publish-and-subscribe system. This accessor will receive data that is
 *  sent by any subscriber that publishes to the same address and runs in
 *  the same Vertx cluster (see the VertxPublish accessor).
 *  The Vertx cluster normally includes all machines that hear multicast
 *  packets sent by the machine hosting this accessor.
 *
 *  The output produced by this accessor may be any data type supported by
 *  accessors that has a string representation in JSON syntax.
 *  The data sent by a VertxPublish accessor is first converted to a string
 *  in JSON format and sent to the event bus. This VertxSubscribe accessor
 *  will parse that string and output the data in the native format of its host.
 *
 *  If the reply input is set to a non-empty value, then whenever this accessor
 *  receives a point-to-point message from the event bus (see VertxPublish),
 *  then it will reply with the specified message, acknowledging receipt.
 *  The reply can also be any data type that has a JSON string representation.
 *
 *  The busHost input specifies the name of the network interface through
 *  which to connect to the Vert.x event bus cluster, and busHostPort specifies
 *  the port to use for this. Normally, you can leave these at their default
 *  values unless you need to need to use a network interface that is not
 *  'localhost' or you need to use a particular port.
 *  These two inputs are examined only at initialization time,
 *  so changing them during execution of a swarmlet will have no effect.

 *  @author Patricia Derler, Edward A. Lee, Ben Zhang
 *  @version $$Id$$
 *  @input {string} address The event bus address, which is the name of the event stream
 *   to which to subscribe. This defaults to 'topic'.
 *  @output message The message received.
 *  @input reply The reply to send back to the sender for point-to-point messages,
 *   or empty to send no reply (the default).
 *  @parameter {string} busHost The name of the network interface to use for the Vert.x
 *   event bus. A blank string is interpreted as 'localhost' (the default).
 *  @parameter {int} busHostPort The port for the Vert.x event bus. A value of 0
 *   indicates to just find an available port (the default).
