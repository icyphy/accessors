/** A motion detector accessor.
 *  This accessor compares each input image against the previous
 *  input image. There are three outputs.
 *  The one named 'output' is a modified image that graphically illustrates
 *  the center of gravity of motion, if motion is detected.
 *  If enough of the pixels differ by enough, then the 'cog'
 *  output will produce the center of gravity of the pixels that
 *  differ by enough.
 *  Finally, the 'area' output produces the percentage of area
 *  covered by motion in the input image, where 0 means no motion
 *  and 100 means full image motion.
 *
 *  The options parameter can include the following fields:
 *  * _PixelThreshold_: Intensity threshold whereby a pixel is
 *    deemed to different (an int in the range of 0 to 255, with default 25).
 *  * _AreaThreshold_: The percentage threshold of image
 *    that has different pixels for motion to be detected
 *    (a double 0-100, with default 0.2).
 *  * _ModifyImage_: If true (the default), the modify the
 *    provided image with a visual indication of the location
 *    and amount of motion.
 *
 *  The implementation for the Ptolemy II host is taken from
 *  the webcam-capture package by Bartosz Firyn (SarXos), available from
 *  [https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture).
 *  The webcam-capture package is licensed under the MIT License.
 *
 *  @accessor image/MotionDetector
 *  @input input A stream of images.
 *  @input {{"PixelThreshold": number, "AreaThreshold": number}} options The options controlling the filter.
 *  @output {array<{'horizontal': 'number', 'vertical': 'number'}>} cog The horizontal and vertical position of the center of gravity of motion, in pixels.
 *  @output {Object} output The filtered image.
 *  @output {number} area The percentage of area covered by motion.
