<h1 class="header">TerraSwarm Accessor Library</h1>
<p>
The TerraSwarm accessor library is an SVN repository that includes a library of accessors
divided into sublibraries, shown on the left. The repository also includes
open-source code for swarmlet hosts.
Click on the libraries at the left to expand them, and click on an accessor
to inspect it. These are displayed below using the
<a href="/accessors/hosts/browser/index.html">Browser host</a>, which is a work
in progress and will not completely display all accessors
(see the <a href="https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/Main/ToDoList">To Do List</a>).
The test library is a good place to start, because all accessors there are compatible with the browser host.
