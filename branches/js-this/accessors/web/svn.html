  <h1>The Accessors Repository</h1>
  <p>
The TerraSwarm accessors repository is an <a href="https://subversion.apache.org">Apache Subversion</a>
(SVN) repository that is readable by anyone. Currently, affiliation with the
<a href="http://terraswarm.org">TerraSwarm Research Center</a> is required to get write access
(see <a href="/terraswarm/faq/2.htm">Who can get a login?</a>).
</p><p>
The repository includes a library of accessors, some swarmlet hosts (including a Browser and
Node.js host), and the <a href="/accessors">http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/</a>
web page contents. It does not include the <a href="http://capecode.org">Cape Code</a>
swarmlet host (which uses its accessor library), nor the
<a href="/accessors/wiki">accessors wiki pages</a>, which are used
to document the accessor API and swarmlet hosts, nor the auto-generated
<a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> JavaScript <a href="https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/doc/jsdoc/index.html">code documentation</a>.
</p><p>
For anonymous read-only access, you can check out the repository using
the command line (assuming you have SVN installed):
  <pre>
    svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn-anon/projects/terraswarm/accessors/trunk/accessors
  </pre>
</p><p>
For read-write access, you need a repo.eecs.berkeley.edu account,
in which case you can check out a tree with:</p>
  <pre>
    svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/projects/terraswarm/accessors/trunk/accessors
  </pre>
</p><p>
The <a href="/accessors">accessors web page</a> and web-accessible
accessor library is updated every five minutes via a cronjob run as the vc user on
moog.eecs.berkeley.edu that does a svn update.
The output produced by this checkout is at <a href="/accessors/svn.out">svn.out</a>.
</p><p>
The JSDoc documentation files are updated by a Jenkins job
(see <a href="/accessors/wiki/Main/JSDoc#CI">JSDoc Continuous Integration</a>).
Note that Jenkins job is not world readable, but the details are world readable.
</p><p>
To update the web pages by hand, see
<a href="http://terraswarm.org/terraswarm/faq/72.html">How do I update workgroup pages using SVN?</a>
