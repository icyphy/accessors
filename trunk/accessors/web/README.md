Terraswarm Accessors
===================

Accessors, described in the paper, [A Vision of Swarmlets](http://www.terraswarm.org/pubs/332.html)
are actors that provide access to a (typically remote) service, sensor, or actuator. An accessor is instantiated by an
**accessor host** or **swarmlet host**, which is a program or browser script. The host uses the accessor as if it were a local
source and/or sink for data and/or commands.
An accessor host is to the Internet of Things what a browser is to the Internet.
It renders a remote service by locally executing a proxy for that service.

This work was supported in part by the [TerraSwarm Research Center](https://www.terraswarm.org),
one of six centers supported by the STARnet phase of the Focus Center
Research Program (FCRP) a Semiconductor Research Corporation program
sponsored by MARCO and DARPA.

This work is also supported by the [Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (iCyPhy) Center](https://www.icyphy.org).

How to update index.json
------------------------
index.json lists all of the accessors, which are all the files [A-Z]*.js [A-Z]*.xml.

To update index.json, run

./updateIndex


How to update the jsdoc output
------------------------------

The doc/jsdoc/ directory contains html created by jsdoc.

To update the docs by hand, run
  ant jsdoc

An automated build on terra.eecs.berkeley.edu updates the docs by checking the accessors repo every 5 minutes.

See [https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/JSDoc).

This file may be found at accessors/web/README.md and is included in the JSDoc output automatically because accessors/web/build.xml is invoked with -R README.md

Install the npm @terraswarm/accessors package on the npm server.
