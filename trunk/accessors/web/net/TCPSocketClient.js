/** This accessor sends and/or receives messages from a TCP socket at
 *  the specified host and port. If the value of the `port` input is initially
 *  negative, then this accessor waits until it receives a non-negative `port`
 *  input before making a connection. Otherwise,
 *  upon initialization, it initiates a connection to the
 *  specified server. If at any time during execution it receives
 *  a 'port' input, then it will close any open socket and, if the new
 *  'port' value is non-negative, open
 *  a new socket to the current 'host' and 'port'.
 *
 *  When the connection is established, a `true` boolean is sent to
 *  the `connected` output. If the connection is broken during execution, then a `false`
 *  boolean is sent to the `connected` output. The swarmlet could respond to this by
 *  retrying to connect (send an event to either the `port` or `host` input).
 *
 *  Whenever an input is received on the `toSend` input,
 *  the data on that input is sent to the socket. If the socket is not yet open,
 *  this accessor will, by default, queue the message to send when a socket next opens,
 *  unless the `discardMessagesBeforeOpen` parameter is true, in which case,
 *  input messages that are received before the socket is opened will be
 *  discarded.
 *
 *  Whenever a message is received from the socket, that message is
 *  produced on the `received` output.
 *
 *  When `wrapup()` is invoked, this accessor closes the  connection.
 *
 *  The send and receive types can be any of those supported by the host.
 *  The list of supported types will be provided as options for the `sendType`
 *  and `receiveType` parameter. For the Ptolemy II host, these include at
 *  least 'string', 'number', 'image', and a variety of numeric types.
 *
 *  If both ends of the socket are known to be JavaScript clients,
 *  then you should use the 'number' data type for numeric data.
 *  If one end or the other is not JavaScript, then
 *  you can use more specified types such as 'float' or 'int', if they
 *  are supported by the host. In all cases, received numeric
 *  data will be converted to JavaScript 'number' when emitted.
 *  For sent data, this will try to convert a JavaScript number
 *  to the specified type. The type 'number' is equivalent
 *  to 'double'.
 *
 *  When type conversions are needed, e.g. when you send a double
 *  with `sendType` set to int, or an int with `sendType` set to byte,
 *  then a "primitive narrowing conversion" will be applied, as specified here:
 *  [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3).
 *
 *  For numeric types, you can also send an array all at once by providing an
 *  array to the `toSend` input port.
 *  The elements of the array will be sent in sequence all
 *  at once, and may be received in one batch. If both ends have
 *  `rawBytes` set to false (specifying message framing), then these
 *  elements will be emitted at the receiving end all at once in a single
 *  array. Otherwise, they will be emitted one at a time.
 *
 *  For strings, you can also send an array of strings in a single call,
 *  but these will be simply be concatenated and received as a single string.
 *
 *  If the `rawBytes` option is set to false, then each data item provided on `toSend`,
 *  of any type or array of types, will be coalesced into a single message and
 *  the receiving end (if it also has `rawBytes` set to false) will emit the entire
 *  message, and only the message, exactly once.  Otherwise, a message may get
 *  fragmented, emitted in pieces, or coalesced with subsequent messages.
 *
 *  When a model with an instance of this accessor stops executing, there
 *  are two mechanisms by which data in transit can be lost. In both cases, warning
 *  messages or error messages will be issued to the host to be displayed or otherwise
 *  handled as the host sees fit.
 *
 *  * First, there might be queued messages that were received on `toSend` but have not yet
 *    been sent, either because the socket has not yet been opened or because
 *    it was closed from the other side.
 *  * Second, a message might be received from the server after shutdown has commenced.
 *    In particular, received messages are handled asynchronously by a handler function
 *    that can be invoked at any time, and that handler might be invoked after it is no
 *    longer possible for this accessor to produce outputs (it has entered its wrapup
 *    phase of execution).
 *
 *
 *  The server might similarly lose messages by the same two mechanisms occurring
 *  on the server side. In that case, messages will presumably be displayed on the
 *  server side.
 *
 *  Accessors that extend this one can override the `toSendInputHandler` function
 *  to customize what is sent.
 *
 *  This accessor requires the 'socket' module.
 *
 *  @accessor net/TCPSocketClient
 *
 *  @input {string} host The IP address or domain name of server. Defaults to 'localhost'.
 *  @input {int} port The port on the server to connect to. Defaults to -1, which means
 *   wait for a non-negative input before connecting.
 *  @input toSend The data to be sent over the socket.
 *  @output {boolean} connected Output `true` on connected and `false` on disconnected.
 *  @output received The data received from the web socket server.
 *
 *  @parameter {int} connectTimeout The time to wait (in milliseconds) before declaring
 *    a connection attempt to have failed. This defaults to 6000.
 *  @parameter {int} idleTimeout The amount of idle time in seconds that will cause
 *    a disconnection of a socket. This defaults to 0, which means no
 *    timeout.
 *  @parameter {boolean} discardMessagesBeforeOpen If true, then discard any messages
 *    passed to SocketClient.send() before the socket is opened. If false,
 *    then queue the messages to be sent when the socket opens. This
 *    defaults to false.
 *  @parameter {boolean} keepAlive Whether to keep a connection alive and reuse it. This
 *    defaults to true.
 *  @parameter {int} maxUnsentMessages The maximum number of unsent messages to queue before
 *    further calls to this.send() will fail. A value of 0 means no limit.
 *    This defaults to 100.
 *  @parameter {boolean} noDelay If true, data as sent as soon as it is available (the default).
 *    If false, data may be accumulated until a reasonable packet size is formed
 *    in order to make more efficient use of the network (using Nagle's algorithm).
 *  @parameter {string} pfxKeyCertPassword If sslTls is set to true and the server requires
 *    client authentication, then this option needs to specify the password for the pfx key-cert
 *    file specified by pfxKeyCertPath.
 *  @parameter {string} pfxKeyCertPath If sslTls is set to true and the server requires
 *    client authentication, then this option needs to specify the fully qualified filename for
 *    the file that stores the private key and certificate that this client will use to authenticate
 *    itself to the server. This path can be any of those understood by the Ptolemy host,
 *    e.g. paths beginning with $CLASSPATH/.
 *  @parameter {boolean} rawBytes If true (the default), then transmit only the data bytes provided
 *    to this.send() without any header. If false, then prepend sent data with length
 *    information and assume receive data starts with length information.
 *    Setting this false on both ends will ensure that each data item passed to
 *    this.send() is emitted once in its entirety at the receiving end, as a single
 *    message. When this is false, the receiving end can emit a partially received
 *    message or could concatenate two messages and emit them together.
 *  @parameter {int} receiveBufferSize The size of the receive buffer. Defaults to
 *    65536.
 *  @parameter {string} receiveType See above.
 *  @parameter {int} reconnectAttempts The number of times to try to reconnect.
 *    If this is greater than 0, then a failure to attempt will trigger
 *    additional attempts. This defaults to 10.
 *  @parameter {int} reconnectInterval The time between reconnect attempts, in
 *    milliseconds. This defaults to 1000 (1 second).
 *  @parameter {int} sendBufferSize The size of the receive buffer. Defaults to
 *    65536.
 *  @parameter {string} sendType See above.
 *  @parameter {boolean} sslTls Whether SSL/TLS is enabled. This defaults to false.
 *  @parameter {boolean} trustAll Whether to trust servers. This defaults to false.
 *    Setting it to true means that if sslTls is set to true, then
 *    any certificate provided by the server will be trusted.
 *    FIXME: Need to provide a trusted list if this is false.
 *  @parameter {string} trustedCACertPath If sslTls is set to true and trustAll is
 *    set to false, then this option needs to specify the fully qualified filename
 *    for the file that stores the certificate of a certificate authority (CA) that
 *    this client will use to verify server certificates. This path can be any of those
 *    understood by the Ptolemy host, e.g. paths beginning with $CLASSPATH/.
 *    FIXME: Need to be a list of paths for certificates rather than a single path.
