/** This accessor sends and/or receives messages from a web socket at
 *  the specified host and port.
 *  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>
 *  provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP/IP connection.
 *  In `initialize()`, it  begins connecting to the web socket server.
 *  Once the connection is established, a `true` boolean is sent to
 *  the `connected` output.
 *  If connection is not established immediately, the accessor will attempt to
 *  reconnect _numberOfRetries_ times at an interval of _reconnectInterval_.
 *
 *  Whenever an input is received on the `toSend`
 *  input, the message is sent to the socket. If the socket is not yet open,
 *  this accessor will, by default, queue the message to send when the socket opens,
 *  unless the `discardMessagesBeforeOpen` parameter is true, in which case,
 *  input messages that are received before the socket is opened will be
 *  discarded. If messages are queued and `throttleFactor` is non-zero, then
 *  whenever a message is queued to be later sent, the accessor's input handler will stall
 *  by a number of milliseconds given by the queue size times the throttleFactor.
 *  The longer the queue, the longer the stall. Note that this will likely block
 *  the host from executing, so this feature should be used with caution.
 *
 *  Whenever a message is received from the socket, that message is
 *  produced on the `'received'` output. Note that the message may actually be sent
 *  over multiple 'frames', but the frames will be aggregated and produced as one
 *  message.
 *
 *  When `wrapup()` is invoked, this accessor closes the
 *  connection.
 *
 *  If the connection is dropped midway, the swarmlet may monitor the 'connected'
 *  output for a value 'false' and attempt a reconnection by providing either a
 *  port or server input.
 *
 *  The default type for both sending and receiving
 *  is 'application/json', which allows sending and receiving anything that has
 *  a string representation in JSON. The types supported by this implementation
 *  include at least:
 *  * __application/json__: The this.send() function uses JSON.stringify() and sends the
 *    result with a UTF-8 encoding. An incoming byte stream will be parsed as JSON,
 *    and if the parsing fails, will be provided as a string interpretation of the byte
 *    stream.
 *  * __text/\*__: Any text type is sent as a string encoded in UTF-8.
 *  * __image/x__: Where __x__ is one of __json__, __png__, __gif__,
 *    and more.
 *    In this case, the data passed to this.send() is assumed to be an image, as encoded
 *    on the host, and the image will be encoded as a byte stream in the specified
 *    format before sending.  A received byte stream will be decoded as an image,
 *    if possible.
 *
 *  When a model with an instance of this accessor stops executing, there
 *  are two mechanisms by which data in transit can be lost. In both cases, warning
 *  messages or error messages will be issued to the host to be displayed or otherwise
 *  handled as the host sees fit.
 *
 *  * First, there might be queued messages that were received on `toSend` but have not yet
 *    been sent, either because the socket has not yet been opened or because
 *    it was closed from the other side.
 *  * Second, a message might be received from the server after shutdown has commenced.
 *    In particular, received messages are handled asynchronously by a handler function
 *    that can be invoked at any time, and that handler might be invoked after it is no
 *    longer possible for this accessor to produce outputs (it has entered its wrapup
 *    phase of execution).
 *
 *  The server might similarly lose messages by the same two mechanisms occurring
 *  on the server side. In that case, messages will presumably be displayed on the
 *  server side.
 *
 *  Accessors that extend this one can override the `toSendInputHandler` function
 *  to customize what is sent. See `RosPublisher.js` for an example.
 *
 *  This accessor requires the 'webSocket' module.
 *
 *  @accessor net/WebSocketClient
 *  @input {string} server The IP address or domain name of server. Defaults to 'localhost'.
 *  @input {int} port The port on the server to connect to. Defaults to -1, which means
 *   wait for a non-negative input before connecting.
 *  @input toSend The data to be sent over the socket.
 *  @output {boolean} connected Output `true` on connected and `false` on disconnected.
 *  @output received The data received from the web socket server.
 *
 *  @parameter {string} receiveType The MIME type for incoming messages,
 *   which defaults to 'application/json'.
 *  @parameter {string} sendType The MIME type for outgoing messages,
 *   which defaults to 'application/json'.
 *  @parameter {int} connectTimeout The time in milliseconds to wait
 *   before giving up on a connection (default is 1000).
 *  @parameter {int} numberOfRetries The number of times to retry if
 *   a connection fails. Defaults to 5.
 *  @parameter {int} timeBetweenRetries The time between retries in milliseconds.
 *   Defaults to 500.
 *  @parameter {boolean} trustAll Whether to trust any server certificate.
 *   This defaults to false. Setting it to true means that if sslTls is set to true,
 *   then any certificate provided by the server will be trusted.
 *  @parameter {string} trustedCACertPath If sslTls is set to true and trustAll is set to false,
 *   then this option needs to specify the fully qualified filename for the file that stores
 *   the certificate of a certificate authority (CA) that this client will use to verify server
 *   certificates. This path can be any of those understood by the Ptolemy host, e.g. paths
 *   beginning with $CLASSPATH/.
 *   FIXME: Need to be a list of paths for certificates rather than a single path.
 *  @parameter {boolean} sslTls Whether SSL/TLS is enabled. This defaults to false.
 *  @parameter {boolean} discardMessagesBeforeOpen If true,
 *   then any messages received on `toSend` before the socket
 *   is open will be discarded. This defaults to false.
 *  @parameter {int} throttleFactor If non-zero, specifies a
 *   time (in milliseconds) to stall when a message is queued
 *   because the socket is not yet open. The time of the stall
 *   will be the queue size (after adding the message) times
 *   the throttleFactor. This defaults to 100. Making it non-zero
 *   causes the input handler to take time if there are pending unsent messages.
