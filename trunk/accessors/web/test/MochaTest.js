/** A composite accessor that accepts a test file name and executes the tests.
 *  Tests are written using the Mocha framework.  The test results are displayed
 *  to the console window.
 *
 *  To run:
 *  For the browser, first, start the test server.  Please see:
 *  /accessors/web/hosts/browser/test/README.txt
 *  Open a browser window and point to:
 *  http://localhost:8088/hosts/browser/test/test/testRunner.html
 *  Click "react to inputs".  The test output will appear at the top of the
 *  page, and also in the browser console window.  You may need to open a
 *  debugging pane to see the console window.
 *
 *  In node, from the command prompt, change to the directory:
 *  /accessors/web/hosts/node/test/mocha
 *  Execute:
 *  node ../../nodeHostShell.js < ./testCommon.js
 *
 *  In Cape Code, there is a demo available at:
 *  $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs/modules/testing/demo/Testing/Testing.xml
 *
 *  The Mocha framework allows developers to describe a test case, execute code,
 *  then check assertions.  Mocha tracks each assertion and reports if the
 *  assertion is satisfied or if it fails.  Add-on libraries extend Mocha's
 *  capabilities.  Chai is an assertion library offering "should", "expect", and
 *  "assert" styles.  Sinon is used for creating test spies, stubs and mocks;
 *  for example, mocking an HTTP response.
 *  Please see this page for instructions on installing Mocha, Chai and Sinon
 *  and writing tests.
 *  https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/wiki/Main/JSMocha
 *
 *  For an overview of the testing capabilities of different hosts, please see:
 *  https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/Testing
 *
 *  Test results are send to the output port and logged to the console.
 *  A future improvement is to format results JUnit-style.
 *
 *  @accessor test/Test
 *  @input testFile The test file to execute.
 *  @output result The test result.
