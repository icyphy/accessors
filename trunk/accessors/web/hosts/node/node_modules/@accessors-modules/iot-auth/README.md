This directory includes *Secure Communication Accessors* as part of SST (Secure Swarm Toolkit), for accessing authorization services provided by local authorization entity, *Auth*.
Secure Communication Accessors are software building blocks that encapsulate cryptographic keys and operations that are used for building trust relationship with other entities and securing network communications.
Therefore, these software building blocks can help IoT developers who are not write IoT applications without worrying about managing cryptography details.
