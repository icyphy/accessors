Instructions for key management in the browser host

Some web services require authentication information such as an API key or 
a username and a password.  This information should NOT be checked in to the
repository.  Instead, please create a local file called "keys.json" in this
directory (/web/hosts/browser/test) which contains the key information in the 
format below.  

Then, an HTML page can issue a request to the server for the key information.
Please see /web/hosts/browser/test/httpClient/testWeather.html for an example. 

Note that this single-file format makes all keys available to all accessors.

The file should contain a JSON object where the {name : value} pairs are
{
	accessor1Name : {parameter1Name : parameter1Value, parameter2Name : parameter2Value, ... },
 	accessor2Name ... 
 }
 
 For example:
 
{
	"GeoCoder" : {
		"key" : "EnterKeyHere"
	}, 
	"Weather" : {
		"key" : "EnterKeyHere"
	}
}

Note that JSON files do not allow comments.

This format assumes there is a single key for all instances of an accessor.
