 *    httpClient.get('http://accessors.org', function(message) {

/** Issue an HTTP request and provide a callback function for responses.
 *  The callback is a function that is passed an instance of IncomingMessage,
 *  defined here. This function returns an instance of ClientRequest, also defined here.
 *  The HTTP request will not actually be issued until you call the end() function on
 *  the returned ClientRequest.
 *  
 *  Note that accessors (as with other scripts) are subject to the same-origin
 *  policy in a browser host.  Therefore sites will be blocked unless the 
 *  server supports cross-origin requests or supports JSON with padding.
 *  For more details please see: 
 *  https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Version0/HttpClient
 *
 *  This implementation ensures that for any accessor that calls this function,
 *  the callback functions are called in the same order as
 *  invocations of this request() function that triggered the request.
 *  If you call this function from the same accessor before the previous
 *  request has been completed (the callback function has been called or it has
 *  timed out), then the request will be queued to be issued only after the previous
 *  request has been satisfied.
 *
 *  The options argument can be a string URL
 *  or a map with the following fields (this helper class assumes
 *  all fields are present, so please be sure they are):
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> body: The request body, if any.  This supports at least strings and image data.
 *  <li> headers: An object containing request headers. By default this
 *       is an empty object. Items may have a value that is an array of values,
 *       for headers with more than one value.
 *  <li> keepAlive: A boolean that specified whether to keep sockets around
 *       in a pool to be used by other requests in the future. This defaults to false.
 *  <li> method: A string specifying the HTTP request method.
 *       This defaults to 'GET', but can also be 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE', etc.
 *  <li> outputCompleteResponseOnly: If false, then the multiple invocations of the
 *       callback may be invoked for each request. This defaults to true, in which case
 *       there will be only one invocation of the callback.
 *  <li> timeout: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response
 *       before triggering a null response and an error. This defaults to 5000.
 *  <li> url: A string that can be parsed as a URL, or an object containing
 *       the following fields:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li> host: A string giving the domain name or IP address of
 *            the server to issue the request to. This defaults to 'localhost'.
 *       <li> path: Request path as a string. This defaults to '/'. This can
 *            include a query string, e.g. '/index.html?page=12', or the query
 *            string can be specified as a separate field (see below). 
 *            An exception is thrown if the request path contains illegal characters.
 *       <li> protocol: The protocol. This is a string that defaults to 'http'.
 *       <li> port: Port of remote server. This defaults to 80. 
 *       <li> query: A query string to be appended to the path, such as '?page=12'.
 *       </ul>
 *  </ul>
 *  @param options The options or URL.
 *  @param responseCallback The callback function to call with an instance of IncomingMessage,
 *   or with a null argument to signal an error.
 *  @return An instance of ClientRequest.
