Inspect accessors in your browser.  Click on an accessor in the list at the left.
Parameters, inputs, and outputs of the accessor are shown as tables.
Documentation is extracted from the accessor specification and displayed on the web page.
</p><p>
A few accessors are also executable within the browser.  Generally, client and 
local machine services are amenable to execution in the browser.  Some accessors 
will always be out of reach because of browser Javascript security restrictions.
</p><p>
For more details and instructions for using and extending the browser
host, see the <a href="/accessors/wiki/Main/BrowserHost">Browser Host wiki page</a>.
