<p>
The browser host allows you to inspect and execute accessors in your browser.  
Try on your desktop or mobile phone!
</p>

To inspect accessors, click on an accessor in the list at the left.
Parameters, inputs, and outputs of the accessor will appear in tables.
Documentation is extracted from the accessor specification and displayed on the web page.
</p><p>
Many accessors are also executable within the browser.  Try audio/ClipPlayer, 
cameras/Camera, some image accessors (may take a while to load) and
many test accessors.  Some accessors will always be out of reach because of 
browser Javascript security restrictions.  Others currently rely on 
non-Javascript code and do not run in a browser.
</p>

host, see the <a href="/accessors/wiki/Main/BrowserHost">Browser Host wiki page</a>.
