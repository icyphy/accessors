<p>
The Browser Swarmlet Host is able to instantiate many accessors in your browser
and provide an interface to them. Parameters, inputs, and outputs of the accessor
are shown as tables. If the modules required by the accessor are all implemented
in the browser host, then you will be able to provide inputs to the accessor and
execute it. Some accessors, however, require resources that the browser cannot grant
due to security restrictions. Such accessors will be displayed, but cannot be executed.
To display and/or execute an accessor, choose one from the library. Its interface
will appear below.
