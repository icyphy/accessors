This directory contains a test script and test accessor for code that is common among
swarmlet hosts. This code should run in any JavaScript environment.  To run the test
in Node.js, just do this:

> node testCommon.js

You may need to first install the 'fs' (filesystem) Node.js module using one of the
following:

> npm install fs
> npm install -g fs
> sudo npm install -g fs
