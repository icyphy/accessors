/**
 * Module supporting TCP sockets.
 * This module defines three classes, SocketClient, SocketServer, and Socket.
 *
 * To establish a connection, create an instance of SocketServer and listen for
 * connection events. When a connection request comes in, the listener will be
 * passed an instance of Socket. The server can send data through that instance
 * and listen for incoming data events.
 *
 * On another machine (or the same machine), create an instance of SocketClient.
 * When the connection is established to the server, this instance will emit an
 * 'open' event. When data arrives from the server, it will emit a 'data' event.
 * You can invoke this.send() to send data to the server.
 *
 * The this.send() function can accept data in many different forms.
 * You can send a string, an image, a number, or an array of numbers.
 * Two utility functions supportedReceiveTypes() and supportedSendTypes()
 * tell you exactly which data types supported by the host.
 * Arrays of numeric types are also supported.
 *
 * If the rawBytes option is true (the default), then data is sent without any
 * message framing. As a consequence, the recipient of the data may emit only a
 * portion of any sent data, or it may even coalesce data provided in separate
 * invocations of this.send(). If rawBytes is false, then messages will be framed so
 * that each invocation of this.send() results in exactly one data item emitted at the
 * other end.  This will only work if both sides of the connection implement the
 * same framing protocol, e.g. if they both are implemented with this same module.
 * To communicate with external tools that do not support this message framing
 * protocol, leave rawBytes set to true.
 *
 * The message framing protocol used here is very simple. Each message is preceded
 * by one byte indicating the length of the message. If the message has length
 * greater than 254, then the value of this byte will be 255 and the subsequent four
 * bytes will represent the length of the message. The message then follows these bytes.
