This folder contains a demo application that is an accessor host for running accessors on Apache Cordova framework. 
The details below and more are also available at https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/Main/CordovaHost

1) INSTALLATION
   - Make sure Android SDK, Jave JDK are installed with environment variables like ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME updated.  
   - Make sure you have an Android emulator or a phone plugged into your machine for the code to be directly deployed to phone.
   - Install Apache Cordova framework. Follow instructions at https://cordova.apache.org/ for downloading and installing the framework. 
   - Install JXCore plugin
     - For this refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/jxc or https://github.com/jxcore/jxc
       - Run "npm install -g jxc"
       - Go to the root of Cordova application folder you created as part of installation steps for Cordova
       - Run "jxc install". In order to test installation, run the following commands: "jxc install --sample express_perf; cordova run android"
     - Run "git clone https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore-cordova io.jxcore.node"
     - Replace the www folder in DemoApp with the www folder from sample: "./io.jxcore.node/sample/www" replaces "./www" 
     - Go to folder ./io.jxcore.node/sample/www. Files index.html and jxcore/app.js can be changed to modify accessor host

2) USAGE
   - Currently, the contents of app.js are pulled in from the contents of nodeHost.js under web/hosts/node/nodeHost.js
   - Also all the require modules, including commonHost.js, util.js and events.js have been copied to this folder. 
   - A test accessor (TestAccessor.js) has been copied as well, app.js launches instantiates/initializes this accessor and provides input for accessor to react. 
   - jxcore/app.js has been appended at the end with commands to launch an accessor and provide input, query outputs.
   - You can run "cordova run android" from current directory to build/deploy the app to a mobile device.
   - You can see that we are essentially running the node host on Android, which executes an accesssor as part of its implementation.
   - Any node modules required by the code can be installed in ./www/jxcore/node_modules 
   - To install node modules, do so from ./www/jxcore folder. Go to that folder and run "sudo jx install jxm --autoremove "*.gz" " 
   - In order to debug your application, use Chrome developer tools at chrome://inspect/#devices

NOTE: Please ignore folders named "backup", if there are any such present under cordova host.
NOTE: Code needs to be refined and updated to make it more usable, along with documentation.   
NOTE: Tests need to be added
