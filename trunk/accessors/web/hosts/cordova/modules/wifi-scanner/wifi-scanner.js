/**
 *  Module for retrieving wifiScan information from an android phone. This module throws
 *  an error if startScan is called on any other platform because
 *  iOS is not supported by the Cordova plugin used by this module. According to the
 *  wifiWizard github project at https://github.com/hoerresb/WifiWizard:
 *
 *  "iOS has limited functionality, as Apple's WifiManager equivalent is only available
 *  as a private API. Any app that used these features would not be allowed on the app 
 *  store. The only function availabe for iOS is getCurrentSSID"

//The WifiWizard module (https://github.com/hoerresb/WifiWizard) has two steps in obtaining scan data:
//first call "startScan" and then after a timeout, call getScanResults.
//I can think of no scenario where an accessor would want to directly control this timeout
//to something other than the least value that yields successful results
//or start a scan without getting the scan results so I have elected to
//combine both functions and specify the timeout inside this module as the following
//magic number. Units are ms.
