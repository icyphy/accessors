/** Respond to textual inputs using the natural-language server from
 *  Google called API.AI (see http://api.ai). To use this, you need to
 *  create an agent at API.AI, using for example the tutorial here:
 *
 *    https://developers.google.com/actions/develop/apiai/tutorials/getting-started
 *
 *  An agent parses input text (natural language) and matches queries against
 *  rules defined in the agent to issue responses. For example, the above
 *  tutorial walks you through creating an agent that asks for your favorite
 *  number and color and then constructs a silly name by concatenating the two.
 *
 *  Once you have created an agent, you should set the '''clientAccessToken'''
 *  parameter to the hex key that identifies the agent. Without this token
 *  this accessor will not do anything.
 *
 *  This accessor is just a starting point. It should be extended
 *  to support multiple languages, for example. Also, it would be nice
 *  if there were a public agent that we could provide a default client
 *  access token for so that the accessor would work out of the box, without
 *  having to go create your own agent.
 *
 *  This accessor uses the apiai modeul, which is supported by at least
 *  the Nashorn (and CapeCode) hosts and the Node.js host.
 *  To use this under the Node.js host, install the apiai NPM module
 *  as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *    npm apiai
 *  </pre>
 *  For the Nashorn host, CapeCode includes a port of the apiai module
 *  that works under Nashorn.
 *
 *  @accessor services/NaturalLanguage
 *  @input {string} textQuery A query that the service is to respond to.
 *  @output {object} response The full response from the service.
 *  @output {string} fulfillment The fulfillment text within the response.
 *  @parameter {string} clientAccessToken The client access token for the service.
