	      <b>Accessors</b> are a technology for making the Internet of Things accessible
	      to a broader community of citizens, inventors, and service providers through open
	      interfaces, an open community of developers, and an open repository of technology.
	      Accessors enable composing heterogeneous devices and services in the Internet of Things (IoT).

	  An <b>actor</b> is a software component
	  that reacts to streaming input events and produces streaming output events.
	  An <b>accessor</b> is an actor that wraps a (possibly remote) device or
	  service in an actor interface.
	  An <b>accessor host</b> is a service running in the network or on a client platform
	  that hosts applications built as a composition of accessors that stream data to
	  each other. The host is like a browser for things. 
	</div>
      </p><p>
    See the <a href="http://www.icyphy.org/pubs/73.html">overview presentation</a>.
	For a quick start using Node.js as a host, see the
	<a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/NodeHost">Node host</a>.
      </p><p>
	Accessors embrace <b>concurrency</b>, <b>atomicity</b>,
	and <b>asynchrony</b>.  The actor model, which governs
	interaction between accessors, permits accessors to execute
	concurrently with segregated private data and a
	message-passing interface for interaction. Internally, many
	accessors use <b>asynchronous atomic callbacks</b>
	(<b>AAC</b>) to invoke remote services and handle responses
	asynchronously and atomically. See
	<a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/ComparisonsToRelatedTechnologies">comparisons with related technologies</a>
	for insight into how accessors work.
      </p><p>
	Accessors are defined in a JavaScript file that includes a specification of the
	<b>interface</b> (inputs, outputs, and parameters) and an implementation of the
	<b>functionality</b> (reactions to inputs and/or production of outputs).
	Any JavaScript file that conforms with the
	<a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Version1/AccessorSpecification"><b>accessor specification</b></a>
	defines an <b>accessor class</b>.
      </p><p>
	The <a href="/accessors/library/index.html">TerraSwarm accessor library</a> provides a collection of example accessors.
	This library is maintained via an <a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/svn.html">SVN repository</a>
	that permits many contributors to add accessors to the library.
      </p><p>
	An <b>instance</b> of an accessor is created by a <b>swarmlet host</b>
	that evaluates the JavaScript in the accessor definition.
	At this time, there are at least three accessor hosts compatible
	with <b>accessor specification 1.0</b>:</p>
      <ul>

	<li>
	A <a href="/accessors/node_modules/@accessors-hosts/browser/index.html"><b>browser
	host</b></a>, which allows inspection of the accessor, and if
	the accessor is suitable for execution in a browser,
	interactive invocation of the accessor.</li>

	<li> A <a href="/accessors/node_modules/@accessors-hosts/node/index.html"><b>Node.js
	host</b></a>, an interactive program that runs in Node.js that
	allows instantiation and execution of accessors.</li>

	<li> A <a href="/accessors/node_modules/@accessors-hosts/ptolemy/index.html"><b>Ptolemy II
	host</b></a>, which supports composition of accessors with
	visual block diagrams and provides a large library of actors
	that the accessors can interact with.</li>

      </ul>
