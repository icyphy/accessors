<h1>Accessors</h1>
<h2>What are Accessors?</h2>
<p>
<b>Accessors</b> are a technology,developed by the <a href="http://terraswarm.org">TerraSwarm Research Center</a>, for composing heterogeneous devices and services in the Internet of Things (IoT).
</p><p>
<div class="boxed">
An <b>actor</b> is a software component
that reacts to streaming input events and produces streaming output events.
An <b>accessor</b> is an actor that wraps a (possibly remote) device or
service in an actor interface.
</div>
</p><p>
Accessors embrace <b>concurrency</b>, <b>atomicity</b>, and <b>asynchrony</b>.
The actor model, which governs interaction between accessors, permits accessors to execute concurrently with segregated private data and a message-passing interface for interaction. Internally, many accessors use <b>asynchronous atomic callbacks</b> (<b>AAC</b>) to invoke remote services and handle responses asynchronously and atomically. See <a href="https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/Main/ComparisonsToRelatedTechnologies">comparisons with related technologies</a> for insight into how accessors work.
</p><p>
Accessors are defined in a JavaScript file that includes a specification of the
<b>interface</b> (inputs, outputs, and parameters) and an implementation of the
<b>functionality</b> (reactions to inputs and/or production of outputs).
Any JavaScript file that conforms with the
<a href="https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/Version1/AccessorSpecification"><b>accessor specification</b></a>
defines an <b>accessor class</b>.
</p><p>
The <a href="/accessors/library/index.html">TerraSwarm accessor library</a> provides a collection of example accessors.
This library is maintained via an <a href="http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/svn.html">SVN repository</a>
that permits many contributors to add accessors to the library.
</p><p>
An <b>instance</b> of an accessor is created by a <b>swarmlet host</b>
that evaluates the JavaScript in the accessor definition.
At this time, there are at least three accessor hosts compatible
with <b>accessor specification 1.0</b>:
<ul>
<li> A <a href="/accessors/hosts/browser/index.html"><b>browser host</b></a>, which allows inspection of the accessor, and if the accessor is suitable for execution in a browser, interactive invocation of the accessor.
<li> A <a href="/accessors/hosts/node/index.html"><b>Node.js host</b></a>, an interactive program that runs in Node.js that allows instantiation and execution of accessors.
<li> A <a href="/accessors/hosts/ptolemy/index.html"><b>Ptolemy II host</b></a>, which supports composition of accessors with visual block diagrams and provides a large library of actors that the accessors can interact with.
</ul>
</p><p>

<p><font color="red">This project is a <b>work in progress</b>. Please contribute. The <a href="http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/">wiki page</a> for this workgroup is the place to go to participate in the design of the accessor mechanism.</font>
