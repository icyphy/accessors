This folder contains a second version of the accessor host based on Apache Cordova.

The main advantage of this version is that it doesn't use JXCore plugin, Node's engine
for Cordova (https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore-cordova). The reason is that the JXCore 
project hasn't been updated since 2014.

Please refer to the helloAccessorWorldCordova folder along with the guidelines in
https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/CordovaHost2 to understand how
to modify this host as needed, and run your own accessors.
