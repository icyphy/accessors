<h1>Accessors</h1>
<h2>What are Accessors?</h2>
<p>
<div class="boxed">
An <b>accessor</b> is a software component that wraps a (possibly remote) device or
service in an actor interface.  An actor <b>actor</b> is a software component
that reacts to streaming input events and produces streaming output events.
</div>
Accessors are defined in a JavaScript file that includes a specification of the
<b>interface</b> (inputs, outputs, and parameters) and an implementation of the
functionality (reactions to inputs and/or production of outputs).
Any JavaScript file that conforms with the <b>accessor specification</b>
defines an <b>accessor class</b>.
</p>
An <b>instance</b> of an accessor is created by a <b>swarmlet host</b>
that evaluates the JavaScript in the accessor definition.
At this time, there are at least three accessor hosts compatible
with <b>accessor specification 1.0</b>:
<ul>
<li> A <b>browser host</b>, which allows inspection of the accessor, and in 

</ul>
      are actors that provide access to a (typically remote) service, sensor, or actuator. An accessor is instantiated by an
      <b>accessor host</b> or <b>swarmlet host</b>, which is a program or browser script. The host uses the accessor as if it were a local
      source and/or sink for data and/or commands.
      An accessor host is to the Internet of Things what a browser is to the Internet.
      It renders a remote service by locally executing a proxy for that service.
    </p>
<p><font color="red">The <a href="http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/">wiki page</a> for this workgroup is the place to go to participate in the design of the accessor mechanism.</font></p>
    <p>
      The TerraSwarm project has developed a "version 0.1" accessor design and a suite of accessor hosts that should be viewed as concept demonstrations. We are further developing the design.
      <a href="http://ptolemy.org/ptolemyII">Ptolemy II</a> (the Development Version in the SVN repository) is currently
      the most complete prototype of an accessor host. In Ptolemy II, the accessors listed here can be
      instantiated using the File-Import-Import Accessor menu item, and can then be incorporated into
      a Ptolemy II model.  For a tutorial on Ptolemy II, see the <a href="http://ptolemy.org/systems">Ptolemy Book</a> (a free download).
      To view the accessor script from within Ptolemy II, double click on the accessor instance, select Preferences, and enable "expert mode."</p>

    <h1>Demos</h1>

    <!-- See https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/wiki/Main/AccessorDemoPolicy -->

    <p>To run the following models, save them to some directory, and open them with a current version of Ptolemy II
      (<a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal">SVN Development Version</a>).
      <i>These models are also available in the ptII svn repo as <code>$PTII/src/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/demo</code></i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>StockTick</b>:
	The
	<a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/demo/StockTick/StockTick.xml">StockTick.xml</a> Ptolemy II model
	accesses and displays the stock prices of the publicly-held sponsors of the TerraSwarm project.
      </li>
      <li><b>Hue</b>:
	The
	<a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/demo/HueToggle/HueToggle.xml">HueToggle.xml</a> Ptolemy II model
	randomly toggles the color of a Philips Hue lightbulb. 
	The
	<a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/demo/HappySadStock/HappySadStock.xml">HappySadStock.xml</a> model
	uses the StockTick accessor to control the color of a Hue lightbulb based on stock prices. 
	You will need to know the IP address of a local Hue Bridge.
      </li>
      <li><b>KeyValueStore</b>:
	Two Ptolemy II models are provided to demonstrate the KeyValueStore accessor.
	<a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/demo/KeyValueStoreClient/KeyValueStoreServer.xml">KeyValueStoreServer.xml</a> provides a server.
	Run this model to create a key-value storage service on your local host.
	<a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/demo/KeyValueStoreClient/KeyValueStoreClient.xml">KeyValueStoreClient.xml</a> provides a simple
	client that uses this server. More interesting clients will be distributed across several machines.
	<br/>
	You <i>may</i> find our server running and accessible.  See <a href="http://ptango.eecs.berkeley.edu:8077/keyvalue/help">http://ptango.eecs.berkeley.edu:8077/keyvalue/help</a>.
