      <h1>Accessors</h1>
      <h2>What are Accessors?</h2>
      <p>
	<b>Accessors</b> are a technology for making the Internet of Things accessible
	to a broader community of citizens, inventors, and service providers through open
	interfaces, an open community of developers, and an open repository of technology.
	Developed by the <a href="http://terraswarm.org">TerraSwarm Research Center</a>, accessors enable composing heterogeneous devices and services in the Internet of Things (IoT).
      </p><p>
	<div class="boxed">
	  An <b>actor</b> is a software component
	  that reacts to streaming input events and produces streaming output events.
	  An <b>accessor</b> is an actor that wraps a (possibly remote) device or
	  service in an actor interface.
	</div>
      </p><p>
	An <b>accessor host</b> is a service running in the network or on a client platform
	that hosts applications built as a composition of accessors that stream data to
	each other. For a quick start using Node.js, see the
	<a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/NodeHost">Node host</a>.
      </p><p>
	Accessors embrace <b>concurrency</b>, <b>atomicity</b>,
	and <b>asynchrony</b>.  The actor model, which governs
	interaction between accessors, permits accessors to execute
	concurrently with segregated private data and a
	message-passing interface for interaction. Internally, many
	accessors use <b>asynchronous atomic callbacks</b>
	(<b>AAC</b>) to invoke remote services and handle responses
	asynchronously and atomically. See
	<a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Main/ComparisonsToRelatedTechnologies">comparisons with related technologies</a>
	for insight into how accessors work.
      </p><p>
	Accessors are defined in a JavaScript file that includes a specification of the
	<b>interface</b> (inputs, outputs, and parameters) and an implementation of the
	<b>functionality</b> (reactions to inputs and/or production of outputs).
	Any JavaScript file that conforms with the
	<a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/wiki/Version1/AccessorSpecification"><b>accessor specification</b></a>
	defines an <b>accessor class</b>.
      </p><p>
	The <a href="/accessors/library/index.html">TerraSwarm accessor library</a> provides a collection of example accessors.
	This library is maintained via an <a href="https://www.icyphy.org/accessors/svn.html">SVN repository</a>
	that permits many contributors to add accessors to the library.
      </p><p>
	An <b>instance</b> of an accessor is created by a <b>swarmlet host</b>
	that evaluates the JavaScript in the accessor definition.
	At this time, there are at least three accessor hosts compatible
	with <b>accessor specification 1.0</b>:</p>
      <ul>

	<li>
	A <a href="/accessors/hosts/browser/index.html"><b>browser
	host</b></a>, which allows inspection of the accessor, and if
	the accessor is suitable for execution in a browser,
	interactive invocation of the accessor.</li>

	<li> A <a href="/accessors/hosts/node/index.html"><b>Node.js
	host</b></a>, an interactive program that runs in Node.js that
	allows instantiation and execution of accessors.</li>

	<li> A <a href="/accessors/hosts/ptolemy/index.html"><b>Ptolemy II
	host</b></a>, which supports composition of accessors with
	visual block diagrams and provides a large library of actors
	that the accessors can interact with.</li>

      </ul>
