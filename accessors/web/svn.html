  <h1>Using Subversion to update the accessors web pages</h1>
  <p>The files that are used to generate the non-wiki and non-JSDoc accessor web pages at
    <a href="/terraswarm/accessors">http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/</a>
    are checked in to a Subversion (svn) repository.</p>

  <p>Only TerraSwarm participants may obtain read/write access to the repository.
    For details, see <a href="/terraswarm/faq/2.htm">Who can get a login?</a>.
    However, the contents of the repository appear at
    <a href="http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/">http://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/</a> and the repository
    is available via anonymous access for non-TerraSwarm participants.</p>
    
  <p>This page is updated every five minutes via a cronjob run as the vc user on moog that does a svn update.
    The output is at <a href="/accessors/svn.out">svn.out</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>The docs are updated by a Jenkins job, see <a href="/accessors/wiki/Main/JSDoc#CI">JSDoc Continuous Integration</a>.  Note that Jenkins job is not world readable, but the details are world readable.</p>
  
  <p>To update these pages by hand, see <a href="http://terraswarm.org/terraswarm/faq/72.html">How do I update workgroup pages using SVN?</a></p>

  <p>Once you have a repo.eecs.berkeley.edu account and access, you can check out a tree with using read/write access with:</p>
  <pre>
    svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/projects/terraswarm/accessors/trunk/accessors
  </pre>

  <p>Note that this svn repo is also available via anonymous access:</p>
  <pre>
    svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn-anon/projects/terraswarm/accessors/trunk/accessors
  </pre>
